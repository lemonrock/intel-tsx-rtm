#![allow(non_upper_case_globals)]

//! This crates provides a simple set of wrappers around Intel's TSX RTM instructions and associated intrinsics.
//! It needs a C compiler to create a small shim.
//! This is important because Rust's compiler does not like code with multiple returns.
//! It does not depend on your compiler having the necessary headers, and so can work with older compilers and other Operating Systems.
//! It uses third-party self-modifying code (Andi Kleen's `tsx-tools`) to provide runtime detection of CPUs without TSX and fallback to non-hardware paths.
//!
