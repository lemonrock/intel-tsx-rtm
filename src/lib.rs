//! # intel-tsx-rtm
//! This crates provides a simple set of wrappers around Intel's TSX RTM instructions and associated intrinsics.
//! It uses code to provide runtime detection of CPUs without TSX and fallback to non-hardware paths.
//! It is best to start with `HardwareMemoryTransactionManager`.
//!
//! It will only compile with nightly (as of February 8th, 2018) because it uses the `asm!` macro.
//!
